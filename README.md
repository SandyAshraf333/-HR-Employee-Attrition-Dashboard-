# -HR-Employee-Attrition-Dashboard-
## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two separate files:  
- `train.csv`  
- `test.csv`

These files were provided as part of a publicly available HR analytics dataset.  
I combined both datasets inside **Power BI** using **Power Query**, and created a unified dataset named:

📄 `HR_Attrition_Employees` 

The combined data includes:
- Employee demographics (age, gender, education)
- Job-related attributes (department, job role, years at company)
- HR metrics (attrition status, job satisfaction, monthly income)
- Performance data (evaluation, working hours, promotion status)

🔍 This combined dataset served as the foundation for the interactive dashboard.
